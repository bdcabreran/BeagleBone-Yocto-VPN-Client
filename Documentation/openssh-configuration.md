# OpenSSH for BeagleBone Black Yocto Project

## What is OpenSSH?

OpenSSH (Open Secure Shell) is a suite of secure networking utilities based on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture. It offers a range of features such as secure remote login, secure file transfer, and port forwarding, among others.

## Including OpenSSH in Your Yocto Project

To include OpenSSH in your Yocto build, you need to ensure the `openssh` package is added to your build configuration. This can be done by modifying your `local.conf` file or directly in your image recipe.

### Modifying `local.conf`

Add the following line to your `local.conf` file, typically located in `build/conf/local.conf`:

```bitbake
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " openssh"
```

### Including in Your Image Recipe

Alternatively, if you are using a custom image recipe, you can include OpenSSH directly by adding it to the `IMAGE_INSTALL` variable like so:

```bitbake
IMAGE_INSTALL += "openssh"
```

## Importance of OpenSSH for Remote VPN Connections

Having OpenSSH on your BeagleBone Black is crucial for setting up secure remote VPN connections. It allows the device to act as a secure client in VPN setups, ensuring that all communications to and from the BeagleBone Black over the VPN are encrypted and secure. This is particularly important in scenarios where sensitive data is being transmitted or when the device is operating in potentially insecure environments. OpenSSH's features like port forwarding also facilitate secure access to and from the BeagleBone Black over a VPN, making it an essential tool for remote administration and secure communication.
